<h3>PC Build</h3>
<p>
I built my 1st PC for my cousins in the winter of 2016 and spent a total of around $500 using all new parts and minimal 
specs in order to save money. I recorded myself and took pictures, it was confsing connecting all the power supply cables 
to the motherboard, and as a 1st time builder I was nervous of plugging in the wrong things. One of the hardest parts was 
picking parts but after i went through much troubleshhoting I realized how easy it was.

<p>
I decided to build my own PC but only got as far as a Case and power supply. I'm taking my time building my PC 
and so far have gotten a total of $30 in rebates and decided to get the parts that wouldn't change. Unfortunately Ram 
and GPU prices skyrocketed since 2016 Christmas and am stuck waiting to get a good price on an RX-480 GPU and 16GB Ram

<h3>Journals</h3>
<p>I like to write short stories of anything that comes to my mind like a blog, I recently started getting into FanFiction
and suspense or Dark action. My most memorable and one that i will continue to reserach isn't fiction but theory based
on the Dimensions of Space and Time or String Theory. I call it "11 Dimensions" and I simply explain in my own words
how to visualize the concept of going beyond the 3rd Dimension. It takes much thinking and imagination to picture what
the 4th dimension and beyond looks like and eventually logic takes the place of visuals</p>
<h3>Gaming</h3>
<p>
I have been a loyal Playstation fan since PS1 but i could never afford it up until PS2 when it was already years old.
My Favorites games are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Metal Gear Solid: Series</li>
	<li>Batman Series</li>
	<li>Fallout Series</li>
	<li>Call of Duty</li>
	<li>Battlefield</li>
	<li>The Last Of Us</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc.</h3>
<p>I skateboard recreationally and think it's the best portable form of transportation</p>

I love to make myself laugh in others with Memes and Gifs and used to be pretty active on a website Memecenter up
until the website became spammed with fake user accounts posting Gore and other unneccesary content, It was also attacked
by Redirects making the site basically in operable. I haven't visited the site since but I do now but it doesn't feel
the same and the userbase seems to have died down
